# Sentiment-Analysis-Frequency-method

# Overview:

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis model implemented using the frequency method. Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. The frequency method involves analyzing the frequency of words in the text to determine the overall sentiment.

# Implementation:

The model is implemented without using any library functions for sentiment analysis. Instead, various methods are used for preprocessing the data, including:

1. Text Cleaning: Removing HTML tags using BeautifulSoup and removing special characters using regular expressions.
2. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words using NLTK's word_tokenize function.
3. Normalization: Converting words to lowercase and removing punctuation.
4. Stopword Removal: Removing common stopwords using NLTK's stopwords corpus.
5. Stemming: Reducing words to their root form using NLTK's PorterStemmer.

# Libraries Used:

Although the sentiment analysis model is implemented without using library functions, the following libraries are used for data preprocessing:

1. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. numpy: For numerical computing.
3. seaborn: For data visualization.
4. matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting graphs and charts.
5. nltk: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stopwords removal.
6. textblob: For processing textual data and sentiment analysis.

# Performance Metrics:

Since the model is implemented without using any library functions, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are not calculated. However, the accuracy of the model can be evaluated qualitatively by analyzing its predictions against ground truth labels.

# Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the appropriate format for sentiment analysis.
4. Modify the code as needed to fit your dataset and problem.
5. Run the appropriate script to preprocess the data and analyze sentiment using the frequency method.
6. Evaluate the model's predictions and adjust preprocessing steps as necessary for better results.
